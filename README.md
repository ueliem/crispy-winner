# A Language

## To Compile

```mlton crispy.mlb```

## Introduction

This is a functional systems language

- Monadic Type System
	- Distinct kinds for pure value expressions and computations with effects
	- Priviledged Monad type constructor, of the Comp sort, for computations with effects 
- Built-in integer and boolean types
- Delta rules
- Applicative module system
- Inductive types

### Long term goals

- Better error messages
- Built-in functions for base types
- Proper interpreter
- Emit Assembly
- Emit executables
- Type preserving compiler (WIP)
